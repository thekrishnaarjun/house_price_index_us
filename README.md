1. Objective
To analyze publicly available data on economic, demographic, and real estate indicators to build a predictive model that explains the impact of these factors on the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, a key indicator of U.S. home prices, over the last two decades.

2. Introduction

The **S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices** serve as critical tools for tracking the fluctuations in single-family home prices across the United States. These indices provide valuable insights into the ever-evolving housing market, allowing us to closely monitor and comprehend the dynamics of home prices. At the heart of this system lies the **S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index**, which offers a comprehensive view of the overall value of single-family homes nationwide. By aggregating data from nine distinct regions, this index provides a holistic perspective. Additionally, city-specific indices allow us to explore average price changes in major metropolitan areas—twenty in total. These areas are further grouped into two composites: one comprising ten metro areas and another encompassing all twenty. An essential feature of these indices is their ability to measure percentage changes in housing market prices while maintaining a consistent level of quality. This ensures that variations due to factors such as house types, sizes, or physical characteristics are excluded from the calculations. In summary, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices empower us to understand and analyze real estate trends effectively.
